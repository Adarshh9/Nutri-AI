# NutriAI: Personalized Nutrition Recommendation System

## üß† Problem Statement
Healthcare professionals and individuals often struggle to find evidence-based nutritional recommendations for specific health conditions. The challenge lies in connecting vast amounts of scientific literature, nutritional data, and medical knowledge to provide personalized, scientifically-backed dietary guidance. Traditional approaches often miss novel food-disease relationships and lack clear explanations for their recommendations.

## üß™ Approach & Solution
NutriAI tackles this challenge through a multi-modal AI approach:
- **Knowledge Graph (KG)** represents structured relationships between foods and diseases
- **Graph Neural Network (GNN)** learns patterns to predict novel food-disease relationships
- **RAG Pipeline** using biomedical embeddings (PubMedBERT) and FAISS for scientific evidence retrieval
- **LLM Integration** with Groq's LLama-3-70B for natural language explanations
- **Reinforcement Learning Cache** system for optimizing response times
- **Interactive Network Visualization** for relationship exploration

## üöÄ Features
- üéØ Evidence-based food recommendations for specific health conditions
- üìö Scientific literature backing for each recommendation
- üîÆ Novel food-disease relationship predictions using GNN
- üí° Concise, scientifically-grounded explanations via LLM
- üìä Interactive network visualizations of food-disease relationships
- ‚ö° Smart caching system using reinforcement learning
- üîç Biomedical literature search with domain-specific embeddings

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack

### 2. Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 3. Configure Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in the root directory:
```env
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key
```

### 4. Run the Application
```bash
python core/app.py
```

The application will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

### 5. Using the Interface
1. Access the web interface through your browser
2. Select or enter a health condition
3. View recommended foods with scientific evidence
4. Explore the knowledge graph visualization
5. Access detailed explanations for each recommendation

‚ö†Ô∏è **Important Notes**:
- Ensure you have sufficient RAM (recommended: 16GB+) for running the models
- The first run will download required model weights
- Cache system will optimize performance over time
- For optimal performance, use a GPU-enabled machine
